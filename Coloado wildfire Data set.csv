It  originated from an unattended fire pit at a local residence.  The wildfire quickly consumed 5 1/2 square miles or 3,500 acres the first day, and forced the evacuation of over 3,000 residents.  Erratic 45-mph gusts sent the fire in two directions at times. Very dry weather conditions preceded the fire.  The combination of strong winds, low relative humidities and dry fuels allowed the wildfire spread rapidly through the steep, heavily forested terrain.  The flames were reportedly 20 to 50 feet in length.  Towns within the burn area included Salina, Wallstreet and Gold Hill.  The dry conditions coupled with gusty winds ranging from 45 to 64 mph persisted for several more days.  ||Fire managers used as many as 700 firefighters and support personnel from 35 agencies and seven air tankers to battle the wildfire.
